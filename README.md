* Jorge Heraud and Lee Redden were both graduate students at Stanford University exploiring commerical vision technology in autonomous vehicles.  The founders dediced to focus on agricultural applications, more specifically lettuce thinning as an inital target application with the goal of growing larger crops.  I got in contact with Jorge through Linkedin to get more insigth into the company.  Jorge explaned that they chose to initally focus on lettuce production because the area they reside has a large agricultural lettuce production.  Jorge was the software engineer and Lee was the mechanical engineer. 
 
* Blue River Technology annonced in March of 2014 they secured $10 million in Series A-1 funding lead by Data Collective Venture Capitol.  In September 2017, John Deere Inc. aquired Blue River Technologies.  Even though John Deere aquired Blue River Technologies, they operate as an indepently-run subsidary that fosters the entreprenueal spirit. The John Deere aquisiton allows Blue River Technologies to leverage company resources such as software, equipment and John Deere Engineers. (Note Series A funding is inital funding to pay employees, start product offerings and develop marketing stratefies.   Series B funding is when a company is making money and is looking to expand in the market.   Series C funding is when a company is preparing to be aquired or go public on the stock market.)

## Business Activities

* Blue River Technology was founded to automate routine agricultural tasks such as weeding and thinning out of crops to yeild better harvests.  Their mission statement from [![Blue River Technology Website](www.bluerivertechnology.com) is "We empower our customers - farmers - to implement more sustainable solutions: optimize chemical usage, reimagine routine processes and imrprove farming yeilds year after year.  We believe that focusing on the small stuff - pixel by pixel and plant by plant - leads to big gains."

* Blue River Technology are primarily the agricultural market - Farmers.   According to Forbes.com the 2020 the smart agricultural market was $1 Billion and projected to grow to $15.3 billion by 2025.

* Blue River Technology offers See and Spray Technology.  See and Spray delivers a targeted spray to weeds, applying herbicide only where needed.  The old model is to genetically modify crops to withstand herbicides and coat the entire field. See and Spray uses artificial intelligence to recognize unwanted growths in fields and treat only those plants.  This allows farmers to plant safer unmodified crops, reduce herbicides by two-thirds and reduces potentailly dangerous herbicide drift. The system used non-residual herbicide which is quickly deactivated in the soil compared to resdiual herbicides which are long-lasting in the soil. See and Spray technology has a 5 year headstart over other their competetors.   Wtih the added resources of John Deere engineering and equipment , Blue River Technology has become the go to for precise weed control technology.  

* The Blue River Technogy was initally created to thin lettuce.  They system uses a "spray them where they are" strategy. Its lettuce bot uses plant images in a computer driven format to identify which plants in real time to remove, spray and use to verify system performance.  In 2017 the technology was expanded to any crop that is grown in rows.  The expanded system steps us precision spraying for corn, soybeans and cotton planted in 30-inch rows or wider.  Through boom-mounted cameras teamed with artifical intelligence machine learning uses millions of data points and pictures to identify and precisly target unwanted plants. "We've taken thousands upon thousands of images of different weeds and plants under different situations such as clear skies, cloudy skies, dark skies, different soils and other residual debries," says Kent Klemme, general manager of See and Spray for Blue River Technology.  The system uses pictures much like a child uses flash cards to learn spelling.  The See uses two sets of cameras that point to the difference between weed and crop the measurement.  This is done about 20 times per second while the machine is operating at an average of 12 mph.  As the machine moves, the technology identifies the plant so that it knows exaclty what it is.  The technology has a database fo more thant 1 million weed images. After the spray has identified the weeds, it will open a specific nozzle relative to the weed sprayer booms.  It will relaease a small amount of chemical growth that kills the unwanted plants.  The system senses the size fo the target plants and and adjusts acording to the target plants.  The larger the targeted plant the larger the spray zone.  The See and Spray system relies on AI with Nvidia chip.The embedded Nvidia Jetson Xavier is a type of graphic processor that is trained to detect weeds from the crops.  Computer vision and data analytics are what drives the selective spraying in agriculture.  This technology helps spraying equipment distinguished between types fo foilage, recognize weeds and make data-driven actions.  This technology combined with custom desgned John Deere agricultural farm equipment alows farmers to grow unmodified crops, cut herbicide usage by two-thirds and allows farmers deeper insights into their cropping systems while improving profitability and crop yields.

## Landscape

* Blue River Technology is in the farming and agricultural sector.  

* According to Precison Reports, Growth in the AI agricultural market is grouped into 4 main categories: Precision Farming, Drone Analytics, Agricultural robots and Livestock Monitoring.  The AI segments are Machine Learning, Computer vision and Predictive Analytics.  The North America agricultual market is driving AI agricultural growth due to the high adoption of advanced AI technologies, the presence of large players that are well funded.  The AI agricultural segment is expected to grow to $15.3 billion by 2025.  

* The major companies in the AI agricultural market are Deere and Company, Agribotix, Ec2ce, IBM, Cainthus, Descartes Labs, The Climate Corporation, Granular, Gamaya, Connecterra, Awhere, Skysquirrel Technologies, Tule Technologies, Prospera, Farmbot, Precision Hawk, Microsoft, Mavrx, Vision Robotics, and Resson.

## Results

* Blue River Technology was one of the first companies to develop and go to market with AI technologies.   Their inial goal was to radically change agriculture by creating intelligent machinery.  They have been able to provide sustanable solutions by reducing the use of herbicides by two-thirds.   The typical broadcast application for herbicides is 3 pounds per acre - which is a cost of $100 per acre.   The See and Spray system allows farmers to reduce herbicide use to 1 pound per acre or a cost of $33 per acre.  According the the USDA the average US farm is 208 acres.  The traditional broadcast method uses 624 pounds of herbicide per treatment at a cost of $20,800.  The See and Spray system allows the use of 208 pounds of herbicide at a cost of $6,933 per treatment.  

* The largest metric of success for Blue River Technology is the reduction of herbicide use and crop yeilds.   Their system allows farmers to reduce herbicide usage by over two-thirds and increases crop yield 40 percent or more year after year.  

* Blue River Technology's revnue is hard to pinpoint due to it being part of a larger company John Deere inc..   Looking at John Deere company statements I estimate their 2020 sales of $21 million.   Their closest competetors are One Concern Inc at $7.4 million, Microblink at $5 million and Brighterion at $7 million.  John Deere aquired Blue River for $305 million a big cost compared to the 2017 company evaluation of $87 million.  

## Recommendations

* I think Blue River Technologies should add features to their technology.  Crops need fertilizer, heat, sunlight and moisture.   Additionally crops are threatened by insects, drought, animal encrochment, weeds and disease.   The current See and Spray system is taking pictures of the fields to identify invasive weeds, what if you added additional AI machine learning that helps to identify other variables that address factors that effect crop yeilds.   The current system could impliment a crop management by exception in the fields.  Train the AI system with red flag warnings that identify other variables that kill crops - insect damage, diseases and low moisture.  My vision is that you get a early warning of danger signs before it becomes a problem.  An example is that if the See and Spray system identifys an insect that is potentially dangerous to the crops - sends an email or alert to the farmer so they can treat the insects before the damage starts or spreads.   This can be done with insects found, insect damage signs, wilty plants due to lack of moisture, or signs of plant disease.  I would also add additional sensors in the fields that monitor fertilizer, heat, sunlight and moisture to give better insight into the crops.   Additional sensors could also monitor fields and alert when animals or humans enter the fields to mitigate any potential negative effects to crop yeilds  

* The offering of additional services will do a couple of things - lock out any potential competetors that enter the marketplace, allow Blue River Technologies to charge more for their services and become a better partner for their client base.  Sales studies show that when a client uses 3 or more products from a company, brand loyalty is increased exponentially.  

* The current technology would have to be scaled to provide more services.   The current technology is already taking pictures of the plant rows to identify invasive plants, you would need train the AI to recognize more factors that affect crop yeilds such as disease, insect damage and low moisture.   The crop management by exception that alerts you to danger signs would need additional sensors and software.  This does not need to all happen at once, but a plan to add an additional service each season that will help the farmer increase yield and make their lives easier.  

* The additional technologies will provide a full solution to their clients that addresses what crops need - fertilizer, heat, sunlight and moisture.  Additionally it will provide the farmer a way to manage their fields by exception - a series of red flag alerts that allows the farmer to catch potential problems before they affect crops.
