## Overview and Origin

* Blue River Technology.

* Company was incorporated in 2011.

* Blue River Technologies was founded by Jorge Heraud and Lee Redden.

* Jorge Heraud and Lee Redden were both graduate students at Stanford University exploiring commerical vision technology in autonomous vehicles.  The founders dediced to focus on agricultural applications, more specifically lettuce thinning as an inital target application with the goal of growing larger crops.
 
* Blue River Technologies annonced in March of 2014 they secured $10 million in Series A-1 funding lead by Data Collective Venture Capitol.  In September 2017, John Deere Inc. aquired Blue River Technologies.  Even though John Deere aquired Blue River Technologies, they operate as an indepently-run subsidary that fosters the entreprenueal spirit. The John Deere aquition allows Blue River Technologies to leverage company resources such as software, equipment and John Deere Engineers. (Note Series A funding is inital funding to pay employees, start product offerings and develop marketing stratefies.   Series B funding is when a company is making money and is looking to expand in the market.   Series C funding is when a company is preparing to be aquired or go public on the stock market.)

## Business Activities

* Blue River Technologies was founded to automate routine agricultural tasks such as weeding and thinning out of crops to yeild better harvests.  Their mission statement is "We empower our customers - farmers - to implement more sustainable solutions: optimize chemical usage, reimagine routine processes and imrprove farming yeilds year after year.  We believe that focusing on the small stuff - pixel by pixel and plant by plant - leads to big gains."

* Blue River Technologies are primarily the agricultural market - Farmers.   According to Forbes.com the 2020 the smart agricultural market was $1 Billion and projected to grow to $15.3 billion by 2025.

* Blue River Technologies offers See and Spray Technology.  See and Spray delivers a targeted spray to weeds, applying herbicide only where needed.  The old model is to genetically modify crops to withstand herbicides and coat the entire field. See and Spray uses artificial intelligence to recognize unwanted growths in fields and treat only those plants.  This allows farmers to plant safer unmodified crops, reduce herbicides by two-thirds and reduces potentailly dangerous herbicide drift.  

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
