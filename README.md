# Blue River Technology

## Overview and Origin

* Blue River Technology.

* Company was incorporated in 2011.

* Blue River Technology was founded by Jorge Heraud and Lee Redden.

* Jorge Heraud and Lee Redden were both graduate students at Stanford University exploiring commerical vision technology in autonomous vehicles.  The founders dediced to focus on agricultural applications, more specifically lettuce thinning as an inital target application with the goal of growing larger crops.
 
* Blue River Technology annonced in March of 2014 they secured $10 million in Series A-1 funding lead by Data Collective Venture Capitol.  In September 2017, John Deere Inc. aquired Blue River Technologies.  Even though John Deere aquired Blue River Technologies, they operate as an indepently-run subsidary that fosters the entreprenueal spirit. The John Deere aquition allows Blue River Technologies to leverage company resources such as software, equipment and John Deere Engineers. (Note Series A funding is inital funding to pay employees, start product offerings and develop marketing stratefies.   Series B funding is when a company is making money and is looking to expand in the market.   Series C funding is when a company is preparing to be aquired or go public on the stock market.)

## Business Activities

* Blue River Technology was founded to automate routine agricultural tasks such as weeding and thinning out of crops to yeild better harvests.  Their mission statement is "We empower our customers - farmers - to implement more sustainable solutions: optimize chemical usage, reimagine routine processes and imrprove farming yeilds year after year.  We believe that focusing on the small stuff - pixel by pixel and plant by plant - leads to big gains."

* Blue River Technology are primarily the agricultural market - Farmers.   According to Forbes.com the 2020 the smart agricultural market was $1 Billion and projected to grow to $15.3 billion by 2025.

* Blue River Technology offers See and Spray Technology.  See and Spray delivers a targeted spray to weeds, applying herbicide only where needed.  The old model is to genetically modify crops to withstand herbicides and coat the entire field. See and Spray uses artificial intelligence to recognize unwanted growths in fields and treat only those plants.  This allows farmers to plant safer unmodified crops, reduce herbicides by two-thirds and reduces potentailly dangerous herbicide drift.  See and Spray technology has a 5 year headstart over other their competetors.   Wtih the added resources of John Deere engineering and equipment , Blue River Technology has become the go to for precise weed control technology.  

* The Blue River Technogy was initally created to thin lettuce.  They system uses a "spray them where they are" strategy. Its lettuce bot uses plant images in a computer driven format to identify which plants in real time to remove, spray and use to verify system performance.  In 2017 the technology was expanded to any crop that is grown in rows.  The expanded system steps us precision spraying for corn, soybeans and cotton planted in 30-inch rows or wider.  Through boom-mounted cameras teamed with artifical intelligence machine learning uses billions of data points and pictures to identify and precisly target unwanted plants.  "We've taken thousands upon thousands of images of different weeds and plants under different situations such as clear skies, cloudy skies, dark skies, different soils and other residual debries," says Kent Klemme, general manager of See and Spray for Blue River Technology.  The system uses pictures much like a child uses flash cards to learn spelling.  The system senses the size fo the target plants and and adjusts acording to the target plants.  The larger the targeted plant the larger the spray zone.  This technology combined with custom desgned John Deere agricultural farm equipment aloows farmers to grow unmodified crops, cut herbicide usage by two-thirds and allows farmers deeper insights into their cropping systems while improving profitability and crop yields.
